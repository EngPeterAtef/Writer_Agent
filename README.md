# Writer_Agent

It's a blog writer expert that takes the topic of the blog and the number of words then uses AI agents to:

* Extract the keywords on the internet related to the topic
* Create a title and a subtitle for the blog.
* Create outlines for the blog using the results of different search engines like Google, Duckduckgo, and Wiki
* use all of these data to create the first draft of the blog.
